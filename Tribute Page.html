            <h2>About the Film</h2>
            <p>
                Released in 1989 and directed by Peter Weir, Dead Poets Society is a powerful drama about a group of students 
                at the conservative Welton Academy whose lives are transformed by their unorthodox English teacher, John Keating, 
                played by Robin Williams.

            <h2>Plot Summary</h2>
            <p>
                Through poetry, literature, and a call to "seize the day" (Carpe diem), Mr. Keating inspires his students to 
                think for themselves and embrace their passions. The film explores themes of individuality, conformity, 
                and the lasting impact of a great teacher.
